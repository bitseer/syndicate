"""
This is the replica gateway's interface to a driver.
This module is meant to be run in a separate process by the RG.
It supports three modes:  "read", "write", and "delete".

The behaviors are described for each mode as follows.  Each mode runs
as an infinite loop.

   When running in "read" mode:

      Read from stdin:
         /path/to/chunk (string)\n
         
      Written to stdout:
         error code (int)\n
         chunk_size (int)\n
         chunk_data (string)\n
         
   When running in "write" mode:

      Read from stdin:
         /path/to/chunk (string)\n
         size_of_chunk (int)\n
         chunk_data (string)\n

      Written to stdout:
         error code (int)\n

   When running in "delete" mode:

      Read from stdin:
         /path/to/chunk (string)\n
         
      Written to stdout:
         error code (int)\n

In all modes, error messages are written to stderr.

When starting up, the gateway *additionally* three three new-line strings 
of Python:

   * the "config" Python code
   * the "secrets" Python code
   * the "driver" python code
   
These strings will be executed, in order to set the CONFIG and SECRETS dictionaries,
and define the read_chunk(), write_chunk(), and delete_chunk() methods.

The gateway signals readiness to the parent daemon by writing the string "ready" to 
stdout.  If the gateway fails to initialize, then it writes "error" to stdout.

The exact protocol is:

   Read from stdin:
      config size (int)\n
      config (string)\n
      secrets size (int)\n
      secrets (string)\n
      driver size (int)\n
      driver (string)\n
      
   Write to stdout:
      0\n         # if successful
      1\n         # otherwise

Exit status codes:
   1    Usage error (check your argv)
   2    Invalid secrets, config, or driver (failed to exec)
   3    Input error from Syndicate (indicates a bug in Syndicate)
   4    Driver error (indicates a bug in the driver)
   
   
The module itself is imported via the 'imp' Python module.  It is always 
loaded to 'syndicate.rg.drivers.running'.
