To build and install Syndicate, you need to install your distro's versions of the following packages.

Fedora 12 (PlanetLab)
   gnutls-devel (for libmicrohttpd)
   openssl-devel
   boost-devel
   boost-system
   libxml2-devel
   libattr-devel
   curl-devel
   fuse
   fuse-devel
   libgcrypt-devel
   protobuf
   protobuf-devel
   protobuf-compiler
   protobuf-python
   xerces-c-devel
   libmicrohttpd-devel (>= 0.9)
   python-daemon
   unixODBC-devel
   libconfig-devel
   Cython (>= 0.19)
   python-devel
   json-c
   json-c-devel
   python-crypto

Fedora 12 users will need Apache Thrift 0.8 installed.
   
Ubuntu/Debian:
   libgnutls-dev
   libssl-dev
   libboost-dev
   libboost-thread-dev
   libboost-system-dev
   libxml2-dev
   libattr1-dev
   libcurl4-gnutls-dev (>= 7.28)
   fuse
   libfuse-dev
   libgcrypt-dev
   libprotobuf-dev
   protobuf-compiler
   python-protobuf 
   libxerces-c-dev
   libmicrohttpd-dev (>= 0.9)
   python-daemon
   unixodbc-dev
   libconfig++-dev
   thrift-compiler (>= 0.8)
   cython (>= 0.19)
   scrypt (python scrypt)
   requests (python requests)
   libjson-c

You will need a version of Apache Thrift (0.8.x) installed to build the AG.  This dependency is transient and will be removed soon.

You will also need a recent version of libmicrohttpd.  At least version 0.9.x should work.

You will additionally need the python bindings for libscrypt installed.  You can get it with "pip install scrypt".

Fedora 12 and Ubuntu 12.04 users may need to build a recent version of libmicrohttpd and Cython themselves, or find an RPM that works.

We have a Syndicate package repository at http://vcoblitz-cmi.cs.princeton.edu/syndicate-nightly/RPMS.  To use, do the following:
   $ sudo curl http://vcoblitz-cmi.cs.princeton.edu/yum/Syndicate-nightly.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/Syndicate.repo

When compiling for Native Client, make sure your /dev/shm (or /run/shm) is mounted with exec, not noexec.
