aptitude install \
   libgnutls-dev \
   libssl-dev \
   libboost-dev \
   libboost-thread-dev \

   lsb-core \
   python-setproctitle \
   python-psutil \
   valgrind \
   zlib1g

Required versions of the above software:
   libmicrohttpd-dev >= 0.9
   thrift-compiler == 0.8 (you might have to build this from source)
   libcurl4-gnutls-dev >= 7.22

You will need a version of Apache Thrift (0.8.x) installed to build the AG.  This dependency is transient and will be removed soon.

You will also need a recent version of libmicrohttpd.  At least version 0.9.x should work.

You will additionally need the python bindings for libscrypt installed.  You can get it with "pip install scrypt" if its not available via your package manager.

Fedora 12 and Ubuntu 12.04 users may need to build a recent version of libmicrohttpd and Cython themselves, or find an RPM that works.

We have a Syndicate package repository at http://vcoblitz-cmi.cs.princeton.edu/syndicate-nightly/RPMS.  To use, do the following:
   $ sudo curl http://vcoblitz-cmi.cs.princeton.edu/yum/Syndicate-nightly.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/Syndicate.repo

When compiling for Native Client, make sure your /dev/shm (or /run/shm) is mounted with exec, not noexec.
