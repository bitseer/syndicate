To install Syndicate on PlanetLab, you need to install the following (Fedora 12) packages:
   gnutls-devel
   openssl-devel
   boost-devel
   libxml2-devel
   libattr-devel
   curl-devel
   fuse
   fuse-devel
   libgcrypt-devel
   uriparser-devel
   protobuf
   protobuf-devel
   protobuf-compiler
   
Following packages are for Ubuntu(Debian):
   libgnutls-dev
   libssl-dev
   libboost-dev
   libxml2-dev
   attr-dev
   libcurl4-gnutls-dev
   fuse
   libfuse-dev
   libgcrypt-dev
   liburiparser-dev
   libprotobuf-c0
   libprotobuf-dev

You will also need a recent version of libmicrohttpd.  The one in Fedora 12 and Ubuntu 12's repositories is too old.  Version 0.9.27 should work.

To build Syndicate on PlanetLab, you need all of the above, as well as:
   git
   scons

To build, you must first build and install libsyndicate.  This is achieved with the following commands:
   $ scons libsyndicate
   $ sudo scons libsyndicate-install

To build the User Gateways:
   $ scons UG

To build the Acquisition Gateways:
   $ scons AG

To install the User Gateways:
   $ scons UG-install

To install the Acquisition Gateways:
   $ scons AG-install
