This is the collection of files for the Syndicate front-end, using Django non-rel
and Google App Engine.

Author: John Whelchel
Date: 5/28/13

Notes:

The root directory for the django project is synweb/. It contains the installed
app synweb, along with other django specfic auto-created code. It also contains
the django non-rel specific code per: www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/djangoappengine

Django SuperUser=syndicate/planetlab

5/29 Goals:
Plan database set-up, reset models (dump DB)
set up simple login first (i.e. we just store username and hashed/salted passwords)
Lay-out views/urls for basic site-map structure
if possible, get deployed and not just on dev-server

To-do:

Update the app.yaml file to match our app (also possibly other .yamls)
see f.souza.cc/2010/08/flying...

Questions:

Should the *.yaml files be in synweb/ or synweb/synweb?
