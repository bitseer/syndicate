% Motivation
\section{Motivation}

% writes to remote files are rare, since usually users write to their own files
% read-heavy
% must speak HTTP/HTTPS
% encrypt metadata, but not file data (since then it can't be cached)
% non-client sources should be allowed

%TAKEAWAY 1: People who need to use large datasets often need to distribute them somehow, because usually many hosts need to work on it. \\
%\\
%We want to make it easier for scientists to distribute large (TB-sized) datasets across the world to each other.
%\\
%We're only concerned about making metadata operations secure, not data transfer (if you want that, encrypt it in advance). \\
