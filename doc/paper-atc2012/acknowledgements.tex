\section{Acknowledgements}

We wish to thank Sapan Bhatia and Andy Bavier for their assistance on technical matters
such as preparing VICCI slices to run Hypercache and FUSE filesystems, as well as providing
guidance on building back-end on Hypercache to interface with public slice-federation architectures
such as VICCI.  We also wish to thank G\"{u}rer \"{O}zen, \c{C}a\u{g}lar Onur, Baris Metin, and Marc Fiuczynski
for their technical assistance in configuring and deploying Hypercache on VICCI.  Additionally, we
wish to thank Verivue, Inc. for allowing us to run their CDN implementation on a publicly-accessible
testbed.
