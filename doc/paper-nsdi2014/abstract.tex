\noindent{\bf Abstract.}  Applications increasingly combine cloud
storage, edge caches, and local storage to host and share data. They
do so, however, in ad-hoc ways, producing a landscape of point
solutions that solve similar problems. This paper describes an
alternative approach that composes storage systems in a general, but
configurable way. The resulting system, called \Syndicate, factors
out data consistency, system security, and storage policies in a
coherent manner, allowing developers to control these functions
independent of the underlying storage. This paper describes
\Syndicate's design, and in particular, its novel consistency
protocol. It also evaluates a PlanetLab-based deployment of
\Syndicate, showing that it introduces a small amount of overhead
relative to directly using underlying storage mechanisms.
