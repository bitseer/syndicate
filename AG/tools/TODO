Curation strategy: the curator creates a filesystem hierarchy where each file has a description of the entry to get.
* For disk, this can just be the file itself
* For sql, this is the SQL query
* For shell, this is the shell command.

The files themselves include the information included for each <Pair> tag.
This hierarchy, along with a config file, determine the XML spec file.  The config file gets turned into the <Config> section.

Curators should maintain such hierarchies for their datasets, and use a tool to generate the spec file.
