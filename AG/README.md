Acquistion Gateway
==================
Acquisition Gateways (AGs) can map file names to various entities such as SQL queries, shell commands etc. and publish them in a Syndicate volume. Currently AG supports three types of mappings, filename to filename, filename to SQL query and file name to shell command. These functionalities are implemented as separate drivers.
