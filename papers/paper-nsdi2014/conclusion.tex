\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presents \Syndicate, a wide-area storage service that
is unique in how it composes existing cloud storage, edge caches,
and local storage to take advantage of the unique capabilities each offers.
By addressing consistency, storage security, and storage policies
as a layer on top of them, \Syndicate\ offers applications a virtual cloud storage
service with the underlying capabilities of leveraged components.
The key to doing so coherently is our novel 
consistency protocol, which leverages existing edge caches to deliver 
consistent data and control plane information to 
a scalable number of end-points.  Our prototype implementation 
validates the design, and demonstrates that \Syndicate\ 
passes on the benefits of underlying systems to applications,
minus a small, configurable overhead.

By interpositioning \Syndicate\ gateways between the key participants
and manipulating the underlying transport protocol (HTTP) and naming
scheme (URIs), \Syndicate\ is able to transparently leverage those
existing services without modification, and in doing so, gives users
the opportunity to select among alternatives (based on their own
criteria, including cost), and yet benefit from the wide-spread
deployment and ongoing operational support they provide
(freeing them from deploying and operating a global service on
their own).  In doing so, we democratize cloud storage by 
enabling user choice and lowering the barrier to entry.

Beyond the specifics of wide-area storage, we believe
\Syndicate\ represents an emerging style of building network system services
through the composition of existing cloud services, and in doing so,
has the potential to encourage a more efficient marketplace for them.
