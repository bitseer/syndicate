\subsection*{Abstract}

This paper presents Syndicate, a wide-area distributed filesystem that
delivers high read performance to a scalable number of readers by
leveraging an underlying content distribution network (CDN).
Syndicate is unique in that it separates file persistence from
read performance by leveraging a CDN to drive data distribution
between clients.  In doing so, Syndicate achieves good aggregate
read bandwidth between its clients despite the poor read bandwidth of 
the underlying data storage.  This architecture also allows the system
to achieve good read performance with a scalable number of clients without
requiring clients to replicate data.

Syndicate provides
conventional read/write and access control semantics while guaranteeing
close-to-open consistency. We evaluate the Syndicate prototype with a series of
microbenchmarks using two CDN implementations in which we test Syndicate's
file I/O latency and bandwidth when reading and writing datasets 
and filesystem hierarchies.
