\section{Design}
\label{sec:design}

As described in our motivation, there are two major aspects to StealthMail’s design.  The first is the subsystem for securely and automatically managing keys.  We refer to this subsystem as AutoKey.  The second is the protocol for sending and receiving emails, called Secure Message Request Protocol (SMRP).  SMRP relies on AutoKey to ensure the sender and receiver have the appropriate keys in place before communicating.

\subsection{Architecture}
Our design assumes Alice and Bob both have sets of trusted user endpoints that run loosely-synchronized clocks, and that each endpoint can access the user's personal cloud storage account for hosting hard state (across sessions).  Additionally, we assume that user endpoints can run code, in execution and resource contexts, outside of the web browser (such as in a VM).

Other than requiring users to have cloud storage, there are four main components of StealthMail (Figure~\ref{fig:overview}):\vspace{0.5em}

{\bf $\bullet$ Endpoint Daemon:} is a program that runs on the user endpoint, separately from the browser.  It performs key and session management, caching, cloud storage access, and cryptographic operations.\vspace{0.5em}

{\bf $\bullet$ Mail UI:} differs from a conventional webmail UI only in that it issues its RPCs to the locally-hosted \emph{endpoint daemon} instead of a remote webmail server. These two components are intentionally separated for practical reasons, because at the time of this writing there is no way to perform cryptography inside the browser without exposing the user to a multitude of Javascript-based attacks (code injection, XSS, and inter-tab leakage).\vspace{0.5em}

{\bf $\bullet$ StealthMail Server:} helps user endpoints discover new messages and assists with backwards compatibility.  It also serves copies of users' public keys, certificates, and storage signatures, which are mirrored by one or more metadata repositories.\vspace{0.5em}

{\bf $\bullet$ Metadata Repositories:} are not required for correct execution as they host redundant information, but using one or more of these increases the number of servers Mal must compromise.\vspace{0.5em}

The endpoint daemon, StealthMail server, and metadata repositories work together to implement the AutoKey system for key distribution. StealthMail servers along with cloud storage, and endpoint daemons work together to implement SMRP.  Figure~\ref{fig:overview} shows how this manifests in inter-component communications.

In AutoKey, each user is given an account public/private key pair, a storage public/private key pair, and one or more signing public/private key pairs.  The private keys are stored encrypted with the user’s password, and only decrypted when the device is running a session.  The account and signing public keys are made available in the form of certificates signed by the account private key.  The use for each key pair is listed in Table~\ref{tab:keypairs}.

\subsubsection{Storage}
StealthMail protects the contents of cloud storage from tampering by replicating cryptographic signatures.  Each file uploaded to cloud storage is sealed with the user's storage private key for confidentiality.  StealthMail organizes the files into a Merkel tree, such that each directory contains the signed hash of all of its children's signed hashes.  Each hash is sealed by the storage private key, making external tampering from Mal evident.

Writing data is similar to two-phase commit.  A writer endpoint prepares to write by generating the new root signature, and replicating it to its StealthMail server and all metadata repositories.  If they all authenticate and accept it, the writer uploads the data to cloud storage, and then broadcasts a signed success message.  Write completes when the StealthMail server and metadata repositories acknowledge upon successful authentication.

Because reads and writes are serialized by the fact that the user does not use two endpoints simultaneously, the metadata repository only needs to store the last root signature it received.  To avoid timing out partway through writing, the endpoint splits large writes into smaller ones and commits them separately.

On read, the endpoint verifies the integrity of cloud storage by fetching the root signatures from these servers and comparing them to the one in cloud storage.  Because Mal cannot compromise all servers, and cannot compromise all channels, the reader will learn if Mal has tampered with a server if the signatures do not match.  These read and write protocols are executed by AutoKey to store trusted public keys in a tamper-evident way.

Given the threat Mal poses to the system, StealthMail employs a fail-fast approach to handling storage faults.  Unavailability or inconsistencies discovered in cloud-hosted data (such as incorrect signatures) are assumed to be due to external interference from Mal.  This is a reasonable trade-off, because it alerts users and cloud storage operators to Mal's presence.  In practice, StealthMail servers are deployed in highly-available infrastructure.

StealthMail is fundamentally a pull-based architecture and only the user's endpoints may write to the user's cloud storage,   Instead of sending data from Alice's endpoint to Bob's email server, Alice will write messages into her cloud storage, and Bob will download them later using SMRP.  This is a departure from SMTP, that can be used to build new features like an ``un-send mail'' feature and to economically disincentivize spam mail by requiring the sender to pay for storage.

\subsubsection{Usability}
A user interacts with StealthMail through the web browser, using the local endpoint as a web proxy.  The UI is stored as files in cloud storage and are signed by the storage private key.  This lets the endpoint verify their authenticity and integrity before serving them over the local trusted RPC channel, effectively preventing code injection attacks from Mal.

Before Alice or Bob can use StealthMail, they must set up the endpoint code.  However, we discuss strategies to facilitate this initial step in the section~\ref{sec:implementation}.  We assume in the following sections that the endpoints all run instances of the endpoint code in local VMs.

\subsection{Bootstrapping Trust}
Before Alice can use StealthMail, she needs an account.  In creating one, she bootstraps AutoKey by establishing her public key and registration date with each component, populating her cloud storage with initial application state, and granting her endpoint permission to access it.  She also establishes security questions and answers to be used to recover her private key, should she forget her password.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/register}
\caption{\it The StealthMail key registration protocol.}
\label{fig:register}
\end{figure}

To do so, her endpoint replicates her account public key and backs up her revocation certificate to more servers than Mal can compromise.  We assume that Mal cannot alter the behavior of the servers during the registration process; if the servers do not behave correctly, the registration fails (Figure~\ref{fig:register}).

From a usability standpoint, creating an account on the StealthMail server is similar to doing so on a webmail server.  Alice begins by submitting a desired username and password to the StealthMail server through the endpoint, as well as any number of hard-to-guess security questions and answers, and the identifier for an uncompromisable out-of-band channel to confirm the registration (e.g. a phone number or existing email address).  The StealthMail-specific extra requirements are the authentication tokens needed to access her cloud storage, and her additional metadata repositories.

Once the information is entered, the endpoint uploads the username and password to the StealthMail server, which replies with a one-time-use registration URL via the out-of-band channel (we assume that Eve cannot determine the password in this step).  Alice navigates to the URL to complete her registration.  Once Alice confirms, the StealthMail server remembers iterated salted hash of the password and out-of-band channel identifier, so Eve and Mal cannot easily learn either and so Alice can use the channel identifier later to reset her password.

Once Alice’s account is created on the StealthMail server, the endpoint sets up her keys and certificates.  It generates her public/private key pairs, and signs the storage and signing public keys with the account private key.  It then generates revocation certificates for the account and storage keys, as well as two public certificates---one for the signing key, and one for the storage key---that contain Alice’s username, the public key, the timestamp, and a nonce for uniqueness (``pubkey certs'' in Figure~\ref{fig:register}).  It signs these certificate with the account private key.

It then proceeds to replicate the account public key and certificates to each server, using the StealthMail server to vouch for her.  To upload them to the StealthMail server, It generates an HMAC over them using the password as the shared secret.  Once the StealthMail server validates and accepts them (remembering the nonce to prevent re-register attacks), the endpoint uploads them to each metadata repository.  The endpoint authenticates to each using OpenID protocol and Alice’s password, where the StealthMail server acts as the OpenID provider.  The metadata repositories do not consider a revocation certificate to be in force until Alice activates it later.

The endpoint finishes by populating Alice’s cloud storage with StealthMail account state, using the authentication tokens she supplied at the beginning of the process.  It uploads her public key certificates as a world-readable files in cloud storage (for Bob to download later) as well as her revocation certificates and account public key (which are NOT encrypted).  It encrypts the private keys and cloud storage credentials using an authenticated symmetric key scheme, deriving symmetric keys from her salted password.  It also seals a copy of the storage private key with the answers to her security questions, so Alice can change her password without losing her data.  The endpoint uploads the security questions and sealed keys to cloud storage, seals the MACs and salts from the encryption with the password, and erases them from RAM, completing the registration and AutoKey bootstrap process.

\subsection{Session Management}
Once AutoKey is bootstrapped, Alice can use multiple endpoints to access her account transparently.  To do so, Alice simply enters her username/password, and the endpoint (via AutoKey) fetches her sealed storage private key, endpoint-specific sealed signing private key, and sealed cloud storage credentials.  For a new device, the endpoint generates a new signing key certificate and revocation certificate for it, seals the private key with the password, and distributes the certificates to the StealthMail server and metadata repositories (which authenticate them with the account public key they obtained on registration).  The servers do not publish the revocation certificates until Alice signals them to do so.

Alice can specify that a user endpoint will be used for only one session (akin to a ``This device is public'' checkbox in webmail).  If so, the signing key will have an expiration date in the very near future, e.g. 30 minutes.

When Alice logs out or her session times out, the endpoint has AutoKey erase any secrets from RAM.  As a precaution, it also erases any data it cached data, and will erase cached data automatically if it restarts. Cached data is always sealed with one of Alice's public keys before being written to local storage, preventing Eve from breaking confidentiality via offline analysis.

\subsection{Key Distribution}
In AutoKey, Bob's endpoint must learn Alice's account, storage, and signing public keys before he can communicate with her.  Once it has them, AutoKey puts them into his cloud storage, executing the two-phase write protocol so his other endpoints can securely and automatically fetch them later.  The challenges are in obtaining them for the first time in such a way that Eve and Mal cannot trick him into learning the wrong ones, and in revoking trust in them without also being tricked.

Bob's endpoint will trust one of Alice's public keys only if AutoKey can get unanimous agreement on the key's value from each server that hosts them, and only if the key is not expired.  Similarly, AutoKey will check for an activated revocation certificate if all servers agree on the same key, and the key is different from the currently trusted key.  This strategy works under our threat model because without Alice's password, Mal is not powerful enough to send the wrong key on every channel, or change it to every server.

While Bob trusts the keys, AutoKey periodically checks to see if it Alice's servers have changed them.  Because the account public key and storage public key do not change as often as the signing key (see the next section), it will check the account key at most once per session.  However, it will check the storage and signing public keys every time Bob sends a message to Alice.

To advertise her keys, Alice's StealthMail address is a well-formed email address that indicates her username, her cloud storage provider, her StealthMail server, and any metadata repositories that host her keys.  We use the character ‘\^’ to separate them---for example, Alice's StealthMail address might be alice\^cloudstorage.com\^keybackup.org@mail.net, indicating that her data is hosted at cloudstorage.com, her keys are replicated to keybackup.org, and her StealthMail server is mail.net.  Each service makes both the keys and certificates available via canonical URLs derived from the username and the service name.  Bob's endpoint has AutoKey use TLS-secured channels with authenticated cipher suites (i.e. AES-GCM) to fetch copies from each service, in order to hedge against external tampering from Mal (but not eavesdropping from Eve).

In the event that some of Alice's services are unreachable, AutoKey continues to trust Bob's copies of Alice's public keys even if there is disagreement among the online servers.  This is to prevent Mal from weakening the system with denial-of-service attacks.  In practice, Alice's services run on highly-available infrastructure, so unreachability problems will be rare and transient.

\subsection{Key Revocation}


\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/revoke}
\caption{\it The StealthMail key revocation protocol.}
\label{fig:revoke}
\end{figure}

Inevitably, AutoKey will need to revoke Alice’s keys for her.  When Alice removes access permission from a trusted endpoint device, AutoKey revokes its signing key.  When she changes or resets her password, AutoKey revokes and regenerates her keys by default because the reason for doing so may be due to a password compromise.

Revoking a signing key is a matter of activating its stored revocation certificate (Figure~\ref{fig:revoke}).  To do so, AutoKey first obtains it by downloading it from each the servers, using a request signed by the account private key.  It also gets a copy from cloud storage.  At least one of the servers will reply with the correct revocation certificate, since Mal cannot compromise all of them under our threat model.

AutoKey then re-uploads it in a signed request to the servers, indicating that the should publish it.  The servers erase the old public key certificate on successful verification, and AutoKey removes it from cloud storage.  Then, when Bob contacts Alice next, his endpoint will detect the key discrepancy, discover the revocation certificate, and stop trusting the old signing key.

If Eve compromises Alice’s password, she will be able to read her incoming messages, and messages sent to others.  If Mal compromises Alice’s password, she can do anything with the account.  To regain control, Alice resets her password, effectively re-registering her account and re-bootstrapping AutoKey using registration protocol described earlier (but with two small differences described below).  As before, we assume that Mal cannot alter the behavior of the servers during re-registration.

Unlike with first-time registration, the StealthMail server requires Alice to submit the same out-of-band communication channel as she did before.  Also, AutoKey sets a flag while uploading new public key information to ask for a reply containing the old revocation certificate.  It also obtains the copy uploaded earlier from cloud storage, and then executes a variant of the signing key revocation protocol to publish the revocation certificates for her account and storage keys.  The only differences are that the revocation certificates will be signed by the new account key, and that the servers will additionally verify the request with OpenID to ensure that it came from Alice (the only person who knows the new password).

When Alice logs in next, her endpoint ``imports'' her old account data by unsealing it with the old storage key and re-sealing it with the new storage key.  If Alice remembers her old password, her endpoint decrypts the old storage key automatically.  If she does not, her endpoint obtains the copy of the storage key sealed with the answers to her security questions, and prompts her for them to decrypt it.

Deleting an account is similar to revoking the keys.  The only difference in the process is that no new keys are generated.

\subsection{Sending, Receiving, and Un-Sending}
Once Alice and Bob have exchanged public keys with AutoKey, they communicate with SMRP, described in this section.  In SMRP, Alice sends Bob a message by sealing it with his storage public key, uploading it to her cloud storage, and making it world-readable. Bob’s endpoint downloads and decrypts it, sanitizes it, and serves it to Bob’s browser for him to read. The same principle applies to attachments, which in StealthMail are sent as separate files to be downloaded.  Alice makes a copy for herself in her ``sent'' folder, if desired.

If Bob expects email from Alice, he can search Alice’s cloud storage for new messages and fetch them.  The UI allows him to query individual contacts for new messages.

The challenge for Bob is to discover when Alice sent him an unsolicited message.  To address this in SMRP, Bob’s StealthMail server acts as a notification service for new email.  Alice sends Bob's StealthMail server a message metadata record, sealed with his storage public key and signed with her signing private key, that identifies herself as the sender and Bob as the recipient.  It serves as a hint to Bob that he has unsolicited mail, and tells him the message recipients, the subject, the human-readable names of the attachments, and the attachment signatures.  This information is hidden from the StealthMail server to provide end-to-end message CIA, and its small size makes it easy for it to store many of them.

When Bob accesses his email, his endpoint downloads and decrypts the unread message metadata records from the server.  Each of them appear in Bob's UI as unread messages. The UI tells Bob the subject, recipients, and attachment names.  Once Bob's endpoint reads and stores the metadata records, the StealthMail server is free to erase them.  

When Bob opens an unread message from Alice, his endpoint downloads, decrypts, and verifies the authenticity and integrity of Alice's message body, using the public keys obtained by AutoKey. Once verified, Bob reads it via the UI. To download an attachment, the endpoint streams it from Alice's cloud storage, verifies it, decrypts it, and delivers it to the UI as a file download.  As a performance optimization (and to assist automatic spam filtering), the endpoint prefetches message bodies as they are discovered.

Mailing lists in SMRP are treated like user accounts.  The only difference is that every participant on the list has a sealed copy of the account storage key and a personal signing key.

In SMRP, Alice can ``un-send'' a message by erasing the body and attachments from cloud storage.  This allows her to withdraw messages sent in haste, or sent accidentally to unintended people.  Bob will discover that she deleted it (i.e. he will receive a metadata record for a message that does not exist), but this may be preferable to having Bob read the entire message.  As such, once Bob obtains a message’s body and attachments, his endpoint replicates them to his cloud storage by default to keep them available even if Alice deletes it later.

\subsection{Searching, Tagging, and Filtering}
Beyond sending and receiving email, webmail users expect automatic spam filtering, the ability to organize messages and conversations, and the ability to search them.  In traditional webmail systems, this functionality resides on the server.  The challenge in providing it in StealthMail is in moving it to the endpoint to preserve confidentiality, but without compromising features.

Tagging messages is a matter of associating a given message with a bag of tags that Bob defines.  Bob’s endpoint incrementally builds an index that pairs each tag to a list of message identifiers.  To search messages by tag, the endpoint fetches a page of the tag’s index, looks up the messages, and serves them to the UI.

To search messages, the endpoint incrementally builds a search index as Bob reads them, using an off-the-shelf indexer.  The indices are updated and synchronized with cloud storage in the background as he opens and reads messages.  As a performance optimization, the endpoint lazily downloads the index by chunk they are needed by the indexer.  It caches them for the session, and asynchronously replicates modifications.

To filter messages, the endpoint uses a combination of a locally-trained classifier and sender blacklists.  Bob has the option of marking messages as spam and marking senders as spammers, in which case the endpoint feeds the message body into its local spam classifier and replicates the classifier’s new model parameters to cloud storage.  This allows the classifier to be used across endpoints without revealing its parameters.  If Bob marks a contact as a spammer, AutoKey revokes trust in its public key, and the endpoint will ignore future messages from it.

Using only a local spam filter is desirable for confidentiality.  The spam classifier model parameters can leak information about the contents of the messages they have classified, so it is important that Bob’s endpoint not share this information directly.  This is in contrast to webmail providers today, which learn to classify spam by monitoring many user accounts.  However, empirical tests~\cite{local-spam-filter-eval} suggest that existing local spam filters can achieve upwards of 98\% effectiveness in practice, suggesting that our strategy should not significantly impact usability if the endpoint code ships with a pre-trained classifier.

\subsection{Backwards Compatibility}
Because email is already a widely-used service, StealthMail must remain backwards compatible with it to allow Alice and Bob to communicate with Charles, a user who relies on conventional email.  To do so, the StealthMail server provides an SMTP/SMRP gateway that translates one protocol into the other.  The StealthMail server has its own cloud storage to hold messages from Charles to serve to Alice via SMRP.  Alice’s messages to Charles are automatically routed through SMTP because Charles does not have a well-formed StealthMail email address.

The gateway alone does not provide \emph{CIA guarantees}.  If Charles wants a limited degree of CIA, StealthMail offers one of two options that require a minimal change in his workflow.  First, if Charles uses PGP already, he will send his public key and encrypted messages via SMTP.  AutoKey obtains Charles’ public key automatically.  While this is less trustworthy than StealthMail’s approach, it is better than nothing, because Mal has only one very short window of time to alter the public key.

If Charles does not use PGP, he must first agree with Alice on a shared secret out-of-band, and assume that Mal does not compromise the StealthMail server or the TLS CA server that vouches for its TLS public key.  To send her a message securely, he navigates to her StealthMail server, enters the secret, and is given a webmail form for composing her a message.  When he submits his message, StealthMail it available to Alice via SMRP.

When Alice replies via SMRP, the StealthMail server sends Charles a URL instead of the message body.  When opened, the StealthMail server gives him a specially-crafted HTML page that contains Alice’s ciphertext, a decryption algorithm in Javascript, and a secret submission form.  When Charles enters the secret, the page decrypts the message for him.
