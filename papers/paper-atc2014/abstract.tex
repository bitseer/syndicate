\noindent{\bf Abstract.}  Email is a core communication mechanism for society.  
Current email protocols, like SMTP and IMAP, do not provide fundamental security 
properties like \emph{confidentiality}, \emph{integrity}, and \emph{authenticity}.  Users can optionally 
employ public-key cryptography like PGP on top of email, but the steps for doing 
so are too complicated for the average user. This paper presents StealthMail, a backwards-compatible email system 
that offers stronger security guarantees while retaining most of the usability 
benefits of webmail.  Our main contribution is a key management protocol that 
performs key generation, distribution, and revocation securely and automatically. 

For message exchange, unlike traditional email, StealthMail uses a pull-based approach where senders 
host messages for receivers to download.  We exploit this to implement an ``unsend'' 
feature, as well as economically disincentivize spam. Our prototype implementation 
and a qualitative usability evaluation show that StealthMail requires less workflow changes than
using PGP with email. Our preliminary evaluation 
shows that the system is responsive enough for typical use.
