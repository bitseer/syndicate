\noindent{\bf Abstract.}  Email is a core communication mechanism for society.  
Current email protocols, like SMTP and IMAP, do not provide fundamental security 
properties like confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.  Users can optionally 
employ public-key cryptography like PGP on top of email, but the steps for doing 
so are too complicated for the average user. This paper presents Security Transparent 
Email with Automatically-managed Keys (STEAK), a backwards-compatible email system 
that offers end-to-end authenticated message encryption with most of the usability 
semantics of webmail.  Our main contribution is a key management protocol that 
performs key generation, distribution, and revocation securely and automatically. 
Users can continue to access email from their various devices.

Unlike conventional email, STEAK uses a pull-based approach, whereby senders 
host messages for receivers to download.  We exploit this to implement an “unsend” 
feature, as well as economically disincentivize spam. Our prototype implementation 
and a qualitative usability evaluation show that STEAK requires less change in 
workflow relative to using PGP with email.  Our preliminary performance evaluation 
shows that the system is responsive enough for typical use.
