\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presents \Syndicate, a wide-area storage service that is
unique in how it leverages existing cloud storage for durability and
existing network caching for scalable performance, providing the
consistency protocol needed to transform those building block services
into a coherent service. A prototype implementation validates the
design, and demonstrates that \Syndicate\ is able to deliver the
performance and scalability of the underlying caching substrate to end
users while preserving data consistency in the presense of writes.

By interpositioning \Syndicate\ gateways between the key participants
and manipulating the underlying transport protocol (HTTP) and naming
scheme (URLs), \Syndicate\ is able to transparently leverage those
existing services without modification, and in doing so, gives users
the opportunity to select among alternatives, based on their own
criteria, including cost.

Beyond the specifics of wide-area storage, we believe \Syndicate\ represents an emerging style of building network system services
through the composition of existing cloud services, and in doing so,
has the potential to encourage a more efficient marketplace for cloud
services. For example, one could imagine an instance of \Syndicate\ that
includes an RG for each of several different cloud storage providers
(e.g., one for S3, one for Rackspace, and so on). In this case,
\Syndicate's value to the user would be to maintain a consistent copy
of data across multiple cloud storage providers, giving users the
security of not being locked into (dependent upon) a single provider.
