\noindent{\bf Abstract.} Cloud storage, network caches, and local
storage are complentary mechanisms for hosting and sharing data in the
wide-area, but they are difficult to use together. This is because
coordination is needed to meet data consistency, durability and
scalability requirements. To address this challenge, this paper
describes \Syndicate, a wide-area read/write storage system that
leverages existing services. \Syndicate\ employs a novel data
consistency protocol that lets wide-area users share consistent data
through independently-operated caches, regardless of where their data
is hosted or archived. \Syndicate\ decouples data durability and
scalable performance while providing consistency in the face of
writes, allowing users to choose whatever underlying caching and
storage implementations meet their needs.
