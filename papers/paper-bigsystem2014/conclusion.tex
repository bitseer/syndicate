\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presents \Syndicate, a wide-area virtual cloud storage
service with software-defined storage semantics.  By interposing
programmable gateways at the contact points between the application
and underlying providers, \Syndicate\ transparently leverages them
without modification, and without coupling applications to them.  In
doing so, \Syndicate\ gives applications the utility benefits various
providers offer, as well as a programming interface for them to define
their storage functionality in a provider-agnostic fashion.

\Syndicate\ is under development, and is being deployed on PlanetLab.
Its source code and documentation are available online at
