\Syndicate\ is a storage service
that builds a coherent storage abstraction from already-deployed
commodity components, including cloud storage, edge caches,
and dataset providers.  It is unique in that it not only offers
consistent semantics across multiple providers, but also
offers a flexible programming model to applications so they can define
their own provider-agnostic storage functionality.  In doing
so, \Syndicate\ fully decouples applications from providers,
allowing applications to choose them based on how well they enhance data
locality and durability, instead of whether or not they provide
requisite features.

This paper presents the motivation and design of \Syndicate, and gives
the results of a preliminary evaluation showing that separating
storage functionality from provider implementation is feasible in
practice.
