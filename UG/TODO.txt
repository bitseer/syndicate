* get everything to compile in FC12 for Nirav and for testing SyndicateMail
* have draft of SyndicateMail ready by week's end
* get automatic build working (investigate existing systems) for nightly 
* get RG drivers working
* get AG block hash working
* get xattrs working
* principles paper!  use example systems to describe why

For SyndicateMail:
* ATC paper: need implementation and evaluation ideas!
* per-Volume OpenID provider information (or built-in authentication)
* clean Python Volume interface
* clean syntool module interface

--- Web caching is Zipfian, and Kazaa is worse-than
--- Web requests are heavy-tailed, and this is even true today with Facebook for example
--- the benefits of cooperative caching are limited at scale--effectiveness grows with log(cache size)
--- means that it's probably good to have a few large caches handle the most popular content, and don't bother with less popular content (pervasive caching might not be worthwhile)
---- """ Thus, there is an interesting tradeoff between naming
----     (hierarchical or not), routing behavior (just route to server,
----     or route to nearest copy), caching behavior (is the working
----     set size small?), the size of objects (which cannot be single
----     packets unless the requests can be handled at packet speeds),
----     and the narrow waist (the waist must be able to operate at line
----     speeds). Here we have suggested (subject to further research,
----     of course) that there is little reason (based on performance)
----     to adopt an ICN design that only caches along path, which
----     implies nonaggregated names, which implies large routing
----     tables, which implies slower name-based routing, which
----     implies large ICN objects, which implies an IP waist. We
----     present this line of reasoning not as a hardened conclusion,
---- """ but as a conjecture that should be investigated.

--- NDN (networking named data)
--- Routers forward packets based on longest content name prefix matching
--- Routers cache packets of data for subsequent requests
--- Router components:
------ Forwarding Information Base (FIB): content prefix --> next hop 
------ Content Store (CS):  cache of packets
------ Pending Interest Table (PIT):  recently requested content items that have not been served
--- Interest packet, Data packet
--- Interest packet is "request"--leaves breadcrumbs in routers en route to content, which get used by routers to send data back to the instigater of the Instance packet
