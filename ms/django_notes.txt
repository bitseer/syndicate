Concepts:
Does the my/all distinction need to even exist?

This is the collection of files for the Syndicate front-end, using Django and webpp2 inside Google App Engine.

DONE ->
- commented all of django_ag/
- When volumes are now created, so is a root directory for them. Default 755 permissions
- Fixed a UG creation error #32
- Made ag_views.deletevolumes and rg_views.deletevolumes transactions
- Changed defaults in setup.py for creating root directories
    + 755 permissions, actual time created used as well.
- Fixed some naming bugs regarding spaces for names for gateways and volumes. Now
  all calls will strip() before converting spaces to underscore 
- On AG viewgateway, if no volumes are attached, now no button shows up asking
  you to remove attached volumes.
- Now when deleting volumes, all other entities are updated accordingly. This is
  yet to be done for other entities yet, so be aware when deleting them that
  there might be rogue ghost traces of it in the MS.


Current task TD -> 
Change strip rules in all the different stuff (volume is done)
get rid of submit buttons when no vols attache (RG/AG admin site)

Tomorrow
- Allow creation of unattached UG's (set v_id to zero)
    + conversely, allow attaching and detaching of volumes.
- Walk through django_rg.views simultaneously with ag after commenting
- Ask Jude: do we want name restrictions on G's to match those on Volumes (i.e. Unicode)?
    + what about for passwords?
- when deleting volumes, is clean-up happening for users and gateways attached?
    + 
- conversely, when deleting gateways, is clean-up happenging for owners and volumes?
- read through others code.
- Transatctionify ag_views.py.deletevolumes. This might be necessary for Rg and Ug as well!
- Clean out magic numbers
- put Try blocks on all gateway.py, user.py, and volume.py Update methods for setattr.


Long term
- Admin site layout consistency for tables. Make sure they scale well with weird text (large names, descrips, configs etc)
- Make more adminy, less fluff.
- Mabye make tests?
- Are the places where I'm using list-slicing to make deep copies ineffecient?

To-do:


- Ask Jude.
	Should Volume record in MS store information on AGs/RGs, or gateway records store information about volumes, or both?
	How should configuration for RG be represented in MS? Or does it need to be at all?
	When a

- fix error for UG delete gateway (? What is this)
- Ask Jude about key_listing methond in Gateway...

Ag have to publish the existence of data in the MS. They can also serve data. Function like UG, can read and write metadata
Rg cannot interact with MS directly, can only read, not write.

MS needs to be able to transmit info/config to gateways (they have to authenticate)
User needs to able to enter JSon/XML or something that specifies configuration of RG (or AG or UG) that dicates
   Ug needs to know whta edge caches to use -> proxy URL and a very simple python function that will take as arg atleast a URL and transforms it into a URL to a network cache. Also needs to go through all volumes, find all UG's with write values to that volume, pass hashed credentials to those UG's so they can all verify each other, based on changes. (this should be periodic too, to detect partitions)

   AG needs generic file (text or something)
   RG same (text or something)
Whenver config changes, needs to be pushed to G's


- Any action a UG does needs Suser credentials -> sessions , renewed every hour or so. (GAESession -> regenerate keys)
- UG's need new boolean flag to dictate read or read/write.

- Use Kib?
- what's with the security issue (live) on firefox?
- After changing settings -> thanks page, where UI-wise should we be redirected to?
- How should 'active' behave? I.e. can you delete an active volume?
- Make a UG handler to a certain POST with certain headers that authenticates a user, makes sure they have rights to the volume they're trying to attach a UG
to, and then create it, update it, or delete it. ms_username should be auto-generated, standard, based on what had been going on with the previous creations
etc. MS will store all hashes. Each UG will store it's own password. Each UG
will have all other UG's (on that volume) hashes. Each post will have:
username, userpassword, volume name, UG-username, UG-password-hash, host, port (change away from base_url)
- Clear out some of the extra logging messages
- This is more for the future, but create a test/suite
- maybe upgrade django to 1.5 (?)

- Javascript pagination for all/myvolumes.

Notes:
	The ms/ subdirectory contains essentially a webapp2 and django app combined under the auspice of GAE. GAE routes via app.yaml anything with the URI prefix '/syn' to the Django WSGI and everything else to MS. '/' handles login etc, and then routes to '/syn/home'. All django files are contained in the various directories prefixed django. 'django_syndicate_web' is the main project app. 'django_home' contains most of the views. Templates and media are self-explanatory.

Django SuperUser=syndicate/planetlab
