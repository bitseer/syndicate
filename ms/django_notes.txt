DONE ->

Numerous bug fixes, session functionality fixes, URI gateway creation/deletion deprecation

- Fix another stale session data bug from deleting volumes
- When deleting RG's and AG's, attached volumes are now updated as well.
  + this does not apply for the URL delete right now, but that's going
  to be changed probably anyway, so currently don't use it.
- Comment django_rg/
- Fix bug when removing both read and write permissions for user to volume
- Fix bug where owner would show up with read/write permissions on volume they owned, if they
  were not the current logged-in user.
- Fix bug where session data was being carried from volume to volume and gateway to gateway.
- Fix bug when deleting volumes, users with read rights would keep ghost rights for the deleted volume.
- Handle situtation where URL requested asks for volume that doesn't exist.
- Eliminated some 'magic' numbers

Current task TD -> 

ON HOLD (1st after finsiehd with TD)

- UG's w/t volumes (set v_id to zero, add that as a comment!)
    + allow creatin w/t volume
        - change required_attrs
    + allow attachment of volume
    + allow removal of volume

Tomorrow

- Comment django_home, django_lib, django_ug, django_volume


- Since schema change, to be checked by Jude
  + *G.py authenticate()
  + Protobuf stuff
  + rg/ag version?

- Is it bad form to have URL's with unmasked volume_ids?
- Ask Jude: do we want name restrictions on G's to match those on Volumes (i.e. Unicode allowed or not? Currently NOT allowed).
    + what about for passwords?

- read through others code.
    + Look at code Jude removed to eliminate exec() how did he do it?


Long term
- Admin site layout consistency for tables. Make sure they scale well with weird text (large names, descrips, configs etc)
- Mabye make tests?!
- Are the places where I'm using list-slicing to make deep copies ineffecient?

To-do:

- Ask Jude about key_listing methond in Gateway...
- Use Kib?
- what's with the security issue (live) on firefox?
- How should 'active' behave? I.e. can you delete an active volume?
- maybe upgrade django to 1.5 (?)

- Javascript pagination for all/myvolumes.

-Secret key for gae_sessions django?
