This is the collection of files for the Syndicate front-end, using Django and webpp2 inside Google App Engine.

To-do:
-SEt a max value for blocksize in django_home/forms.py
-Fix the permissions in the viewvolume in django_home...
-Make website front-facing...
-Internal validation in MS/ for create_user and create_volume (i.e. length and what charactesr are allowed). 
-Secret key for gae_sessions django. 
-Figure out how to gracefully handle errors on form entry pages for creating things. 
-And for wonky usernames in emails possibly.
-Implement list-all methods

Notes:
	The ms/ subdirectory contains essentially a webapp2 and django app combined under the auspice of GAE. GAE routes via app.yaml anything with the URI prefix '/syn' to the Django WSGI and everything else to MS. '/' handles login etc, and then routes to '/syn/home'. All django files are contained in the various directories prefixed django. 'django_syndicate_web' is the main project app. 'django_home' contains most of the views. Templates and media are self-explanatory.
