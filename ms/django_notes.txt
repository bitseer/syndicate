Done-s

To-do:
- Why is user a paramter to create UG?
- Make template folder for all the gateway crap, and use {% extend %} to simplify it.
- get rid of all queries
- fix error for UG delete gateway
- Put URL instructions at the top of gateway creation/deletion pages.
- for AG/RG/UG Guis, rather than do HttpResponses on errors, do "message" style.
- make sure gateway names can handle spaces the way volumes do.
- are override forms actually necessary?
- Does Django home.forms.py need to exist?
- AG/RG ListAll Jude style and add my style for all 3 to make more consistent with Volumes.
- AG/RG parameters
- Consolidate AG/RG views if possible
- Ask Jude about key_listing methond in Gateway...
- Create AG and RG in gateway.py
Ag have to publish the existence of data in the MS. They can also serve data. Function like UG, can read and write metadata
Rg cannot interact with MS directly, can only read, not write.

MS needs to be able to transmit info/config to gateways (they have to authenticate)
User needs to able to enter JSon/XML or something that specifies configuration of RG (or AG or UG) that dicates
   Ug needs to know whta edge caches to use -> proxy URL and a very simple python function that will take as arg atleast a URL and transforms it into a URL to a network cache. Also needs to go through all volumes, find all UG's with write values to that volume, pass hashed credentials to those UG's so they can all verify each other, based on changes. (this should be periodic too, to detect partitions)

   AG needs generic file (text or something)
   RG same (text or something)
Whenver config changes, needs to be pushed to G's


- Any action a UG does needs Suser credentials -> sessions , renewed every hour or so. (GAESession -> regenerate keys)
- UG's need new boolean flag to dictate read or read/write.

- Use Kib?
- what's with the security issue (live) on firefox?
- After changing settings -> thanks page, where UI-wise should we be redirected to?
- How should 'active' behave? I.e. can you delete an active volume?
- Make a UG handler to a certain POST with certain headers that authenticates a user, makes sure they have rights to the volume they're trying to attach a UG
to, and then create it, update it, or delete it. ms_username should be auto-generated, standard, based on what had been going on with the previous creations
etc. MS will store all hashes. Each UG will store it's own password. Each UG
will have all other UG's (on that volume) hashes. Each post will have:
username, userpassword, volume name, UG-username, UG-password-hash, host, port (change away from base_url)
- Clear out some of the extra logging messages
- This is more for the future, but create a test/suite
- maybe upgrade django to 1.5 (?)

- Javascript pagination for all/myvolumes.

Notes:
	The ms/ subdirectory contains essentially a webapp2 and django app combined under the auspice of GAE. GAE routes via app.yaml anything with the URI prefix '/syn' to the Django WSGI and everything else to MS. '/' handles login etc, and then routes to '/syn/home'. All django files are contained in the various directories prefixed django. 'django_syndicate_web' is the main project app. 'django_home' contains most of the views. Templates and media are self-explanatory.

Django SuperUser=syndicate/planetlab
