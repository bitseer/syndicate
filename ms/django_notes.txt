Done-

To-do:

- what's with the security issue (live) on firefox?
- After changing settings -> thanks page, where UI-wise should we be redirected to?
- How should 'active' behave? I.e. can you delete an active volume?
- Make a UG handler to a certain POST with certain headers that authenticates a user, makes sure they have rights to the volume they're trying to attach a UG
to, and then create it, update it, or delete it. ms_username should be auto-generated, standard, based on what had been going on with the previous creations
etc. MS will store all hashes. Each UG will store it's own password. Each UG
will have all other UG's (on that volume) hashes. Each post will have:
username, userpassword, volume name, UG-username, UG-password-hash, host, port (change away from base_url)
- Clear out some of the extra logging messages
- This is more for the future, but create a test/suite
- maybe upgrade django to 1.5 (?)

- Javascript pagination for all/myvolumes.

Notes:
	The ms/ subdirectory contains essentially a webapp2 and django app combined under the auspice of GAE. GAE routes via app.yaml anything with the URI prefix '/syn' to the Django WSGI and everything else to MS. '/' handles login etc, and then routes to '/syn/home'. All django files are contained in the various directories prefixed django. 'django_syndicate_web' is the main project app. 'django_home' contains most of the views. Templates and media are self-explanatory.
