  + *G.py authenticate()
  + Protobuf stuff
  + rg/ag version?

- Is it bad form to have URL's with unmasked volume_ids?
- Ask Jude: do we want name restrictions on G's to match those on Volumes (i.e. Unicode allowed or not? Currently NOT allowed).
    + what about for passwords?

- read through others code.
    + Look at code Jude removed to eliminate exec() how did he do it?


Long term
- Admin site layout consistency for tables. Make sure they scale well with weird text (large names, descrips, configs etc)
- Mabye make tests?!
- Are the places where I'm using list-slicing to make deep copies ineffecient?

To-do:

- Ask Jude about key_listing methond in Gateway...
- Use Kib?
- what's with the security issue (live) on firefox?
- How should 'active' behave? I.e. can you delete an active volume?
- maybe upgrade django to 1.5 (?)

- Javascript pagination for all/myvolumes.

-Secret key for gae_sessions django?
