This is the collection of files for the Syndicate front-end, using Django and webpp2 inside Google App Engine.

Author: John Whelchel
Date: 5/28/13 - 6/27/13

Done:
- move createvolume to django_volume/
- When not entering password for add permissions or change permissions, make sure to return the form the way they had it originally
- Set up email to owner for 'request to join'

To-do:

- Clear out some of the extra logging messages
- Talk to Jude about ancestor keys
- This is more for the future, but create a test/suite
- Create cron job for gaesessions
- Talk with Jude about Read_Fresh and cache issues.

- User settings
- Should volumes be public/private?
- Get rid of django stupid error messages, or just modify css to fix them and get rid of mine.

- Authenticate doesn't seem to be working perfectly when stopping/starting server and going straight to random pages (try myvolumes). This has to do with stale sessions. Connect with cron
job issues.
-SEt a max value for blocksize in django_home/forms.py
-Internal validation in MS/ for create_user and create_volume (i.e. length and what charactesr are allowed). 
-Secret key for gae_sessions django. 
-Figure out how to gracefully handle errors on form entry pages for creating things. 
-And for wonky usernames in emails possibly.

Notes:
	The ms/ subdirectory contains essentially a webapp2 and django app combined under the auspice of GAE. GAE routes via app.yaml anything with the URI prefix '/syn' to the Django WSGI and everything else to MS. '/' handles login etc, and then routes to '/syn/home'. All django files are contained in the various directories prefixed django. 'django_syndicate_web' is the main project app. 'django_home' contains most of the views. Templates and media are self-explanatory.
