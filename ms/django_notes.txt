- Should have all can read/write field for Volume/UG
- Add UG field to volume
- I have a slice now. Let's make this happen.

CSS
- Get rid of nasty hover on logo.
- Make sure all tabs have enough content to reach all the way donw
- Browser compatibility

Tomorrow

- Transaction on volume.views.create for creating Root dir?
    + Is there ever a situation where creating a volume doesn't involve creating a root dir? Can I add that to volume.py create?

- Ask Jude: do we want name restrictions on G's to match those on Volumes (i.e. Unicode allowed or not? Currently NOT allowed).
    + what about for passwords?

- read through others code.

Long term
- Admin site layout consistency for tables. Make sure they scale well with weird text (large names, descrips, configs etc)
- Mabye make tests?!

To-do (future):
- what's with the security issue (live) on firefox?
- maybe upgrade django to 1.5 (?)
- Javascript pagination for all/myvolumes.
- Secret key for gae_sessions django?
