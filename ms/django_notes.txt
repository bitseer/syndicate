Concepts:
Does the my/all distinction need to even exist?

This is the collection of files for the Syndicate front-end, using Django and webpp2 inside Google App Engine.

DONE ->
- Fix transactions in volume.py.create and gateway.py.create[s]
- Got rid of override forms
- Got rid of 'settings' and 'downloads'
- Commented django_home/, django_lib/, django_syndicate_web/, django_ug/, django_volume
- Created a 'failure' view for volumes when the volume is private and the user trying to access
  it doesn't own it (or if the volume) doesn't exist, which hides the URL's better.

Current task TD -> 

Tomorrow

- Transaction on volume.views.create for creating Root dir?
    + Is there ever a situation where creating a volume doesn't involve creating a root dir? Can I add that to volume.py create?

- Ask Jude: do we want name restrictions on G's to match those on Volumes (i.e. Unicode allowed or not? Currently NOT allowed).
    + what about for passwords?

- read through others code.

Long term
- Admin site layout consistency for tables. Make sure they scale well with weird text (large names, descrips, configs etc)
- Mabye make tests?!

To-do (future):
- what's with the security issue (live) on firefox?
- maybe upgrade django to 1.5 (?)
- Javascript pagination for all/myvolumes.
- Secret key for gae_sessions django?
