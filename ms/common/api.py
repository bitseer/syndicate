      also own the Volume in which the gateway resides.  This is to prevent
      an arbitrary user from gaining unwarranted capabilities.

      This method only makes sense for User Gateways.  An Acquisition Gateway
      is only supposed to be able to write metadata into its Volume, and a Replica
      Gateway never needs to access a Volume.  Attempts to give AGs or RGs 
      different capabilities will silently fail.
